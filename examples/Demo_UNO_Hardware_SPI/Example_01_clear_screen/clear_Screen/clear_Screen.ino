// IMPORTANT: LCDWIKI_SPI LIBRARY MUST BE SPECIFICALLY
// CONFIGURED FOR EITHER THE TFT SHIELD OR THE BREAKOUT BOARD.

//This program is a demo of clearing screen to display black,white,red,green,blue.

//when using the BREAKOUT BOARD only and using these hardware spi lines to the LCD,
//the SDA pin and SCK pin is defined by the system and can't be modified.
//if you don't need to control the LED pin,you can set it to 3.3V and set the pin definition to -1.
//other pins can be defined by youself,for example
//pin usage as follow:
//             CS  A0/DC  RESET  SDA  SCL  BLK    VCC     GND    
//Arduino Uno  A2    A3     A4    11   13   A0    5V      GND

//Remember to set the pins to suit your display module!
